Pachi stands on the research shoulders of giants:

Move Evaluation in Go using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
	Chris J. Maddison, Aja Huang, Ilya Sutskever & David Silver

Computing Elo Ratings of Move Patterns in the Game of Go
	RÃ©mi Coulom

Modification of UCT with Patterns in Monte-Carlo Go
	Sylvain Gelly, Yizao Wang, Remi Munos & Olivier Teytaud

Combining Online and Offline Knowledge in UCT
	Sylvain Gelly, David Silver

And many others...



The 54% dcnn was trained by Detlef Schmicker and graciously shared
with the computer-go community.



Pachi contains unpublished methods we claim we have invented
independently:

* The dynamic komi feature.
* The local tree feature.



These people have made significant contributions to the code:

Petr Baudis
	Pachi the Bot ;-)

Jean-loup Gaily
	Distributed engine
	Time allocation algorithm
	Efficient UCT memory allocator

Lemonsqueeze
	Seki, dcnn, mm patterns
	Raspberry Pi =)
